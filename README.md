## Description
The goal of this software is to demonstrate the effect of ensemble variance reduction methods in the paper, including the kernel+compromise decision and the efficient budget allocation methods.

## Building
A prerequisite to build the files is a license for IBM CPLEX. Our source code can be quickly built with Apple Xcode. Please use the project files 'LShape_xcode.xcodeproj' in src/SMIP_VarianceReduction or in src/SMIP_OCBA. Alternatively, our code can be built with CMAKE. All the source files are in the src folder.

The following figure illustrates the OCBA computational results: the evaluated sample size and estimated objective for the top 5 candidate solutions.

## Replicating
To replicate the results, please compile the src for both variance reduction and the efficient budget allocation methods. Please use the scripts in the 'scripts' folder, and run the compiled programs with the input data in the 'data' folder.

For example, if you want to run the first variance reduction method in the paper. Here are the steps:
1. Copy all the instances in the 'data' folder to 'src/SMIP_VarianceReduction/LShape_xcode/spInput'
2. cd src/SMIP_VarianceReduction/LShape_xcode
2. Unzip the 'compiled file.zip'
3. Execute 'run.sh'
